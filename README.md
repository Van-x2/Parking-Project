My aim for this project was to create a simple website that let you reserve parking spaces on my highschool campus. 
I started this project after I heard about some drama occuring due to people parking in other peoples perferred spots on accidednt, and that it was I seek to solve.
The contents of this project are not solely my own work. I have used many different libs, this is more of just a project to get me more familiar with web dev as a whole.

Update:
After about 3 months of programming, I have reached my initial goal for this little project. 
I decided to host the project on fly.io because of their cheap hosting if anyone wants to check it out, the link is: [ksmparking.fly.dev](https://ksmparking.fly.dev/). For security reasons, I dont allow users outside of my schools email domain from creating acounts.

Update:
After 1 week, my school formally released an email reinforcing rules related to parking on campus. 
On top of this, they also added a new rule stating that there can be no external systems for kids to claim parking spaces for themselves.

Guess it was fun while it lasted!
